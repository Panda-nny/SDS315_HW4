Within this repository contains a pdf writeup of my report, as well as a Rmarkdown file with my code. Also included are the files used to create my report.

To replicate, download all files to the same folder and knit the rmd file.

Libraries that need to be installed include tidyverse, mosaic, tokenizers, and kableExtra.
